<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Party playlist is an application that allows a user to create playlist for a party and invite their friends to add
songs to the playlist and vote on the songs they want to hear first.

Party Playlist was a NSS group project completed with three other team members: Matt Leigh, Jake Price, and Matthew Reuther.

Each team member was responsible mostly for designing their assigned API from backend to frontend. 
For instance, while one member was tasked with the `GetPlaylistBySongId` API another was tasked with `GetGuestList` API.
Other tasks like adding design features to the frontend were handled by Jake Price and Matthew Reuther,
while building the songs table script and table design were handled by Matt Leigh and me.

### What I Learned

Before this project, I knew how to build a frontend design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to build
back a backend design using Java and AWS services. What I learned in this project is how to connect the two.
While I conceptually understood the path from the client to the database and back, I learned how to successfully code
that entire path and how they are all integrated. At the start of the project, building a successful API path
took me at least two days (with hours of debugging). By the end, I was start and finish one in an hour.

In addition, I became more confident in my debugging skills using DevTools and remote debugging with Docker.
Over the course of the project, I became familiar with common errors and was able to hunt down bugs faster.

Most of all, I learned how to work well with a team. While I was lucky to work with such competent and flexible
teammates, we still ran into problems. One was how to efficiently divvy up tasks. In our first sprint, the tickets
we assigned ourselves were a bit too broad, clumsy, and too reliant on code another teammate was working. In our second
sprint, these tasks were much more concise, efficient, and more independent of each other.
